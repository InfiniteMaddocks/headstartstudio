          <h2>About HeadStart Studio</h2>
          <p>
            HeadStart Studio is built on a simple idea: adult film work should be conducted with the
            same level of professionalism and respect as any other production. That means clear
            communication, written agreements, ID verification, defined boundaries, and a safe set.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are based in New York and operate on a small, controlled set environment — no party
            chaos, no surprises, and no pressure to do anything outside of the fully agreed plan.
